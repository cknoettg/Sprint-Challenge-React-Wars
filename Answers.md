1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

ReactJS is a JavaScript library that allows you to render components
client-side (or even server-side) in a Virtual Dom. It allows you to
create webpages and apps without multiple HTML files, and doesn't hit
the actual DOM. You can actually create HTML-like elements using Java
Script via JSX.

1. Describe component state.

State is data or a data structure that you can attach to a component.
ReactJS uses UseState for a variable that can hold data, and a setter or
other method.

1. Describe props.

Props are properties/characteristics that you can assign to components.
Can help you hold data values about elements in your component. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are when you can use an entity outside of the scope in which it is called - but still in a controlled manner. Sync effects can be used to change default states based on user behavior for an interactive experience on the web.
